  <h1>Sierpinski Triangle</h1>
  <h2>A Sierpinski Triangle (aka Sirpinski Gasket) is a 2 dimensional fractal, named after Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński. Having been shown a program similar to this in a lecture, I decided to try to recreate it with no outside help, both for fun, and as a way to practice writing code in javascript. <br><br>  This was created using the p5.js library, and this is my first time using p5.js. The documentation for this library can be found at <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5js.org</a>. I recommend checking it out if you're interesting in a simple library for creating graphics in js.</h2>
